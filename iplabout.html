<h3 style="margin-left:20px;">Indian Premier League</h3>
<br><br>
<p style="width:90%;margin-left:20px;">The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional Twenty20 cricket league in India contested during March or April and May of every year by eight teams representing eight different cities in India. The league was founded by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in 2008. The IPL has an exclusive window in ICC Future Tours Programme.
The IPL is the most-attended cricket league in the world and in 2014 ranked sixth by average attendance among all sports leagues. In 2010, the IPL became the first sporting event in the world to be broadcast live on YouTube. The brand value of the IPL in 2019 was ₹475 billion (US$6.7 billion), according to Duff & Phelps. According to BCCI, the 2015 IPL season contributed ₹11.5 billion (US$160 million) to the GDP of the Indian economy.
</p>
<br><br>
<h5 style="margin-left:20px">History</h5>
<br>
<p style="width:90%;margin-left:20px;">On 13 September 2007, the BCCI announced the launch of a franchise-based Twenty20 cricket competition called Indian Premier League whose first season was slated to start in April 2008, in a "high-profile ceremony" in New Delhi. BCCI vice-president Lalit Modi, said to be the mastermind behind the idea of the IPL, spelled out the details of the tournament including its format, the prize money, franchise revenue system and squad composition rules. It was also revealed that the IPL would be run by a seven-man governing council composed of former India players and BCCI officials and that the top two teams of the IPL would qualify for that year's Champions League Twenty20.</p>
<p style="width:90%;margin-left:20px;">In order to decide the owners for the new league, an auction was held on 24 January 2008 with the total base prices of the franchises costing around $300 million. At the end of the auction, the winning bidders were announced, as well as the cities the teams would be based in: Bangalore, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Kolkata, Mohali, and Mumbai. In the end, the franchises were all sold for a total of $723.59 million</p>
<br><br>
<h5 style="margin-left:20px">Tournament Rules</h5>
<br>
<p style="width:90%;margin-left:20px;">A team can acquire players through any of the three ways: the annual player auction, trading players with other teams during the trading windows, and signing replacements for unavailable players. Players sign up for the auction and also set their base price, and are bought by the franchise that bids the highest for them. Unsold players at the auction are eligible to be signed up as replacement signings. In the trading windows, a player can only be traded with his consent, with the franchise paying the difference if any between the old and new contracts. If the new contract is worth more than the older one, the difference is shared between the player and the franchise selling the player. There are generally three trading windows—two before the auction and one after the auction but before the start of the tournament. Players cannot be traded outside the trading windows or during the tournament, whereas replacements can be signed before or during the tournament.<br><br>
Some of the team composition rules (as of 2020 season) are as follows:
</p>
<ul style="width:90%;margin-left:40px;">
<li>The squad strength must be between 18 and 25 players, with a maximum of 8 overseas players.</li>
<li>Salary cap of the entire squad must not exceed ₹850 million (US$12 million).</li>
<li>Under-19 players cannot be picked unless they have previously played first-class or List A cricket.</li>
<li>A team can play a maximum of 4 overseas players in their playing eleven.</li>
</ul>
<p style="width:90%;margin-left:20px;">The term of a player contract is one year, with the franchise having the option to extend the contract by one or two years. Since the 2014 season, the player contracts are denominated in the Indian rupee, before which the contracts were in U.S. dollars. Overseas players can be remunerated in the currency of the player's choice at the exchange rate on either the contract due date or the actual date of payment.
</p>
<br><br>
<h5 style="margin-left:20px">Prize Money</h5>
<br>
<p style="width:90%;margin-left:20px;">The 2019 season of the IPL offered a total prize money of ₹500 million (US$7.0 million), with the winning team netting ₹200 million (US$2.8 million). The first and second runners up received ₹125 million (US$1.8 million) and ₹87.5 million (US$1.2 million), respectively, with the fourth placed team also winning ₹87.5 million (US$1.2 million).
